# Contributing Guidelines

Make sure your pull request follows these guidelines:

- Search through the previous pull requests before making a new one! 🙏
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[Resource Title](url) — description.`
- Expand on why the resource is useful in your pull request if needed.
- Keep descriptions short and simple.
- Add new categories or improve existing categories if possible -- it's welcome!
- Double check your spelling and grammar! 😁
- Keep entries sorted alphabetically by title.
- The docs for niri state that "niri" is canonically written in lower-case. So "Niri" is fine in the item name if the item is named such, but please use "niri" in the item description. If it is at the start of a sentence then try to reframe it such that the sentence does not start with it. Only capitalize it if absolutely necessary!

Basic entry formatting requirements have to be checked via a [awesome-lint](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-lint). Run it locally first.

Thanks for contributing!
